Hello! My name is Eugene (he/they). I'm a third-year PhD student in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at UCLA. My current research concerns the evolution of competitor recognition and territoriality between bird species. I am also passionate about science communication and making scientific information accessible to a wide audience. Beyond my academic career, I am a huge nerd who loves dungeons & dragons, fantasy novels, anime, and video games. On my blog Otherworldly Ecologies, I write about how ecological principles, and biology more generally, show up in my favorite media.

Thanks for visiting! I'm so happy you're here :)
