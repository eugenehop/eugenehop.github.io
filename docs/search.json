My current research concerns the evolution of competitor recognition and territoriality between bird species. I am also passionate about science communication and making scientific information accessible to a wide audience. Beyond my academic career, I am a huge nerd who loves dungeons & dragons, fantasy novels, anime, and video games.\nI post two types of content on this site: under the “News” tab, you can find current information about my research, explainers of coding techniques I find useful, and updates about conferences I attend. For something a little more fun, I use my blog “Genre Ecologies” to break down ecological and biological principles using examples from my favorite media.\nThanks for visiting! I’m so happy you’re here :)"
